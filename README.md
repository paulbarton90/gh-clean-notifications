# Github CLI Clean Notifications

A small [gh](https://github.com/cli/cli) extension to help cleanup notifications
for when a pull request or issue is marked as closed or merged.

## Prerequisite

Prior to setting up this tool to be used, you'll need to add the "notifications"
scope to your gh token. Your token can be refreshed to get the scope via `gh
auth refresh --scopes notifications`.

The correct scopes can be verified via `gh auth status`. The last line it prints
informs you of the "Token scopes".

## Usage

```shell
gh clean-notifications [Flags]
```
